# keylogger
A PoC keylogger, developed as my first step into malware development. 

Stored in the .rsrc section of the exe generated from https://github.com/CourtneyJane2904/Dropper-Keylogger. 

DISCLAIMER: although very basic and only running on Windows devices without extra antivirus software, I'm not responsible for any damage caused by this project as this was developed for academic purposes.
